# Project 6

During this project, I acquired knowledge about the concept of classes in JavaScript, which serve as blueprints for creating objects. This hands-on experience allowed me to create classes with unique characteristics and properties, further enhancing my understanding of object-oriented programming. Moreover, I practiced class inheritance, enabling one class to inherit properties and behaviors from another

### Skills Used in Project
- Created 3 classes:
   - A Shape class that serves as a base for the other two
   - A Rectangle class that is inherited from Shape class
   - A Triangle class that is inherited from Shape class

- Used for..of and switch() to create a generic block of code that processes information from the classes,
and creating new objects from those classes
